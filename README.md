# sre-challenge-02-token-vendor
This repository contains my implementation of Speed Run Ethereum – Challenge 02: Token Vendor. The project demonstrates how to design, build, and deploy a fully functional ERC-20 token and an on-chain vending machine that can buy and sell tokens using ETH. It is built using Scaffold-ETH 2, Hardhat, and Next.js.
